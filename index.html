					<p>Millburn Splash is a weekly robotics class taught by members of the Millburn High School Robotics
						Team, including members of our VEX World Champion team, helping to spread the joy and
						learning of robotics. We have a unique philosophy: we help out students discover their talents
						and technique through problem-solving, a necessary skill for higher-level robotics competitions
						and any projects that our students may eventually undertake.
					</p>
					<p>
						At Millburn Splash, we use the VEX IQ building system, but in a unique way: we create a
						cooperative competition that forces our students to innovate, learn, and grow together, while also
						providing a meaningful goal that our students will work towards. Additionally, our small class sizes 
						ensure that everyone has an opportunity to build, program, and drive their creations.

						VEX IQ is a robotics platform tailored for elementary and middle school students that encourages STEM skills,
						such as hands-on building and programming abilities. VEX IQ is learned in a cooperative environment that
						fosters healthy competition in order to keep students engaged and eager to learn. In addition to the technical
						skills, students will learn about the engineering process and how to properly document their. VEX IQ will help
						students develop out of the box thinking and foster creativity through the design process of their robots.

								<p> <b> Design and Creation &mdash; Grades 3-8 &mdash; 9:00AM - 11:30AM or 1:00PM - 2:30PM, M-F &mdash; </b>
									In this class, students will be separated into two groups based on their level of knowledge. Students will be introduced to some additional build techniques and mechanisms. Also, we will focus on building linkages and holonomic drives, while also learning the programming necessary to control these designs. We will also teach different types of manipulators and intake, along with more complex gearing and movement mechanisms. </p>
								<p> <b> Programming I &mdash; Grades 5-8 &mdash; 9:00AM - 11:30AM, M-F &mdash; </b>
									This class is a student's introduction to sensor usage to control their robot. Throughout the class, students will gain experience with the gyroscope, distance sensor, and line following. Although this class is mostly taught in a graphical environment, the knowledge students gain is easily transferable to any other programming language. </p>
								<p> <b> Programming II &mdash; Grades 7-8 &mdash; 1:00PM - 2:30PM, M-F &mdash; </b>
									In this programming class, we encourage analytical thinking for our students. We use a text-based programming environment for this class to provide additional control over the robots for the students. Instead of teaching algorithms, students will learn how to imagine and design their own control algorithms for their robots. By the end of this course, students will be prepared to code any competition-ready robot's autonomous routines. </p>
								<p> <b> Python &mdash; Grades 7-8 &mdash; 9:00AM - 11:30AM, M-F &mdash; </b>
									In this course, kids become familiar with one of the most widely used general-purpose programming languages and the various tools associated with it allowing them to collect, analyze and present data as well learning about automation and interacting with real-world services. An introduction to all of these concepts builds the foundations necessary for a student to create their own projects in the future. </p>
								<p> <b> Web Development &mdash; Grades 4-7 &mdash; 1:00PM - 2:30PM, M-F &mdash; </b>
									Learn to code your own personal website portfolio over an eight-week course using HTML and CSS. The program will explain the basics of HTML, advance to CSS by the 4rd week, and finish up with basic JavaScript in the 6th and 7th week. By the end of the 8th week, each student will have a personal website created with images, buttons, and animations. </p>
								<p> <b> Machine Learning &mdash; Grades 6-8 &mdash; 1:00PM - 2:30PM, M-F &mdash; </b>
									In this programming class, students will learn the foundations of creating machine learning models as well as learn the fundamental math behind how it works. We will explore state of the art models in fields such as Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Time-Series prediction along with the necessary data preparatory steps. By the end of the course, students should be able to create and implement models from scratch. </p>
